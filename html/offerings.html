          You may need it to release stress, sleep better, get ride of some
          trauma, anxiety or bad habit…
          <br />
          or maybe you are just curious to try it and discover how you can
          connect with yourself and your emotions, and ease your mind. <br />
          Meditation is one key to reduce negative emotions and thoughts, and it
          will also benefit you physically lowering resting heart rate and blood
          presure. <br />
          We can practice <em> Yoga Nidra </em> that will allow you to access a
          state of deep healing and restoration by activating your delta
          brainwaves.
