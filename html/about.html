      <div class="txt bloc-txt">
        I discovered Yoga while travelling around South America.
        <br />
        Passing by Hare Krishna’s Temples, I was initiated to Yoga and to the
        Vedic Philosophy. Since, the concept of “all is one” grew inside me
        along with the practice of yoga.
        <br />

        Yoga gave me peace, but also a structure. <br />
        It is a philosophy as much as it is a practice. <br />
        A philosophy of acceptance, devotion, union. A practice of discipline
        and letting it go. <br />
        Not only I could feel the physical benefits on my body, stronger, more
        energized, also I started to feel more grounded and connected.
        <br />
        Altogether, I felt better! <br />
        This is what I want to share through Yoga and why I have started
        teaching it.
        <br />
        Interested in a holisitc approach of the body and how to take car of it,
        I started practicing Energetic Therapies three years ago.<br />
        In 2019, I graduated of 200H Yoga Teacher Training of Vrinda Bhumi
        School in India, where I also learned some of the basis of Ayurveda and
        Ayurvedic Massages Saatwika Ayurveda Academy.

        <br />Combining Meditation and Energetic Therapy, I got rid of my
        hyperphagia and it helped me a lot going out of depression and changing
        my perspectives. Anytime I am feeling down I know I can turn towards
        those tools<br />
        I genuinely want people to feel good, which is why I started offering
        energetic cares.

        My approach into sharing yoga is to make you listen to your own body.
        Instead of trying to reproduce what you may think is "The way to do it"
        or a perfect shape, you'll get to connect with yourself. Your shape is
        what matters, and how you evolve with and within it.
        <br />
        <div class="emphase">
          As Every Body Is Different, Each Practice is Unique
        </div>
        You will dive into deep breathwork, make your energy flow easily through
        you, release tensions. I will guide you into cultivating
        <em> body awareness</em>, pointing out micro adjustments you can create
        in a posture, giving you the understanding of where to take the energy
        from and how to create space in your body.
        <br />
        I give importance to the core and pelvic work as it is fundamental for
        good posture and to relief backpain.
        <br />

        Yoga is for everybody !
        <br />
        I cannot stress that enough ! Do not bridle yourself : you don't have to
        be already strong, or flexible… You'll eventually get to it by
        practicing Asanas consistently but that's not the only point for
        practicing yoga.
        <br />
        Connection, of body, mind and spirit is what is seeken. <br />
        So you just have to be you, willing to inner grow, opening your body,
        your mind and your spirit. Not that's anything easy… Sometimes laying
        ourselves bare can be challenging, here is when the practice makes you
        elvove.
        <br />
        Own your practice, it is yours !

      <div class="title bloc-title">How I Practice</div>
      <div class="txt bloc-txt">
        Some days I like to flow improvising new <em> Vinyasas</em>, some other
        days I follow a strict <em>Hatha</em> pattern. Sometimes I add up reps
        or fascia work techniques, and other times I just melt in a
        <em>Yin practice</em> of restoration. Days I just breath consciously and
        this is all.
