      <div class="heading--bloc margin">My Yoga Journey</div>
      <div class="txt bloc-txt">
        I discovered Yoga travelling around South America, mostly passing by
        Hare Krishna’s Temples.
        <br> While I was initiated to the Vedic Philosophy, the concept of “all is one” and Union of Body, Mind and Soul grew inside
        me. I started practicing Energetic Therapies through which you can only
        perceive human and his surroundings in a holistic way.
        <br> In 2019, I graduated of 200H Yoga Teacher Training of Vrinda Bhumi School in
        Verkala - India, where I also learned some of the basis of Ayurveda and
        Ayurvedic Massages Saatwika Ayurveda Academy. 
        <br>
        <br> Yoga gave me peace, but also a structure. 
        <br> It is a philosophy as much as it is a practice.
        <br> A philosophy of acceptance, devotion, union. A practice of discipline and
        letting it go.
        <br> Not only I could feel the physical benefits on my body,
        stronger, more energized, also I started to feel more grounded and
        connected. Altogether, I felt better!
        <br> This is what I want to share
        through Yoga and why I have started teaching it.

      <div class="heading--bloc">How I Practice</div>
      <div class="txt bloc-txt">
        Some days I like to flow improvising new <em> Vinyasas</em>, some other days I
        follow a strict <em>Hatha</em>  pattern. Sometimes I add up reps or fascia work
        techniques, and other times I just melt in a <em>Yin practice</em> of
        restoration. Days I just breath consciously and this is all.
      </div>
      <div class="heading--bloc">How I Teach</div>
      <div class="txt bloc-txt">
        My approach to teach yoga is to make you listen to your body and
        cultivate <em> body awareness</em>, pointing micro adjustments you can create in a
        posture, giving you the understanding of where to take the energy from, how to create space in your body.
        <br>
        I give importance to the core and pelvic work as it is fundamental for
        good posture and relief backpain. 
        <br>
      <div class="emphase"> As Every Body Is Different, Each Practice is Unique </div>
      Yoga is for everybody, own your practice, it is yours !
      Do not bridle yourself, you'll see how good you'll feel after one session.
